It is well known that any RSA encryption can be undone by just encrypting the
ciphertext over and over again. If the RSA modulus has been chosen badly then
the number of encryptions necessary to undo an encryption is small.
If n = 0x112b00148621 then only 209 encryptions are necessary as the following
example demonstrates:

>>> e = 65537
>>> n = 0x112b00148621
>>> pt = 0xdeadbeef
>>> # Encryption
>>> ct = pow(pt, e, n)
>>> # Decryption via cycling:
>>> pt = ct
>>> for _ in range(209):
>>> Â  pt = pow(pt, e, n)
>>> # Assert decryption worked:
>>> assert ct == pow(pt, e, n)

However, if the modulus is well chosen then a cycle attack can take much longer.
This property can be used for a timed release of a message. We have confirmed
that it takes a whopping 2^1025-3 encryptions to decrypt the flag. Pack out
your quantum computer and perform 2^1025-3 encryptions to solve this
challenge. Good luck doing this in 48h.
