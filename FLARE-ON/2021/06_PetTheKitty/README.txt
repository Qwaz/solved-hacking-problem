Hello,

Recently we experienced an attack against our super secure MEOW-5000 network.

Forensic analysis discovered evidence of the files PurrMachine.exe and PetTheKitty.jpg; however, these files were ultimately unrecoverable.

We suspect PurrMachine.exe to be a downloader and do not know what role PetTheKitty.jpg plays (likely a second-stage payload).

Our incident responders were able to recover malicious traffic from the infected machine.

Please analyze the PCAP file and extract additional artifacts.

Looking forward to your analysis,

~Meow
