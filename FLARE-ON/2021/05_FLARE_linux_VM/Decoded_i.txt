The only problem with RC4 is that you need a key. The FLARE team normally uses this number: "SREFBE" (as an UTF-8 string). If you have no idea what that means, you should give up and bake some muffins.


The 5th byte of the password is: 0xMS


If this challenge is too difficult and you want to give up or just in case you got hungry, what about baking some muffins? Try this recipe:
0 - Cinnamon
1 - Butter 150gr
2 - Lemon 1/2
3 - Eggs 3
4 - Sugar 150gr
5 - Flour 250gr
6 - Milk 30gr
7 - Icing sugar 10gr
8 - Apple 100gr
9 - Raspberries 100gr

Mix 0 to 9 and bake for 30 minutes at 180Â°C.
